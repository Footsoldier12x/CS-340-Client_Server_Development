## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Writing programs that are easy to read by utilizing standardized guidelines is the best way to create maintaiable, readable, and adaptable programs.
One of the primary advantages for coding in a standardize manner is that others can look at your code and assist with troubleshooting. Additionally, going back to read older code is also easier to troubleshoot when dealing with large programs such as the Grazioso Salvare Project.
Because the AnimalShelter CRUD module receives dictionary type inputs, it can work with other classes with very few modifications.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?


## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
